# Add Perks For Enemies To Spawn With

Got the idea from a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/noita/comments/viyu14/nightmare_is_fun/idiqhpa/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and thought this was to do.

I basically merged Noita's Nightmare mode with the [Start Perks](https://github.com/Purpzie/start_perks) mod.

Future plans might be to select perks for invidual enemies.
